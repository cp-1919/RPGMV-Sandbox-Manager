## Progress
I am focusing on developing this plugin. However, I have too much things to do. It is difficult for me to keep on developing it, but eventually I will finish this plugin.

I have already finished following things:
1. Create objects in the map in first-perspection
2. Generate blocks when the map is loaded
3. Leared how to use webrtc (yes, i will make an online game)

Hope everything goes well.
